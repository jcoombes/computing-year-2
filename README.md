Second year undergraduate Physics computing project.

In this project you will try to optimise the design of a particle physics experiment by simulating what you would see in your detector for different configurations. While this example is a little simplified, this sort of simulation is exactly the approach used by particle physicists to design even the most complicated experiments (such as those at the LHC).
